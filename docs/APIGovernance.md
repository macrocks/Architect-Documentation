API Governance in MuleSoft ensures that APIs are designed, developed, deployed, and managed in a secure, standardized, and scalable way. The key topics under API Governance include:

-Versioning Strategy
API versioning is crucial for managing changes and ensuring backward compatibility in MuleSoft applications. Here’s a brief overview of an effective API versioning strategy:
```
1. Semantic Versioning
Use semantic versioning to clearly communicate the nature of changes:

Major Versions (X.0.0): Introduce breaking changes that are not backward compatible.
Minor Versions (1.X.0): Add new features in a backward-compatible manner.
Patch Versions (1.0.X): Implement backward-compatible bug fixes1.
2. Deprecation Policy
Establish a clear deprecation policy to manage the lifecycle of API versions:

Announcement: Notify consumers about the deprecation of an API version well in advance.
Support Period: Provide a support period during which both the old and new versions are available.
Sunset: Clearly communicate the sunset date when the deprecated version will no longer be supported2.
3. Documentation and Communication
Maintain comprehensive and up-to-date documentation for each API version:

Changelog: Include a changelog that details the changes in each version.
Migration Guides: Provide guides to help consumers migrate from one version to another3.
4. Versioning in URLs
Incorporate version numbers in the API URLs to differentiate between versions:

Example: /api/v1/customers and /api/v2/customers.
5. Backward Compatibility
Ensure that minor and patch versions are backward compatible to minimize disruptions for API consumers.

6. Testing and Validation
Thoroughly test new API versions to ensure they meet quality standards and do not introduce regressions.
```
By following these strategies, you can effectively manage API versions, minimize disruptions for consumers, and maintain a high level of service quality. 

-Consistency in URI Structures
Follow and be consistent URI structure to make it more readable, concise and easy to understand. 
e.g.  /api/v1/customers
/api/{versio}/{domain}/{resource}  e.g. /api/v2/pay/accounts

## Security & Compliance
-Authentication & Authorization (OAuth 2.0, JWT, Basic Auth)

-API Policies (Rate Limiting, IP Whitelisting, CORS)
IP Whitelisting- 
whitelist/allow IP inbound traffic

CORS
  CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that allows or restricts web applications running on different origins (domains) from accessing your API resources.
  
  Why is CORS Needed?
  By default, web browsers enforce a same-origin policy, which blocks requests from a different domain, protocol, or port. CORS allows controlled access to your API from different origins by specifying which domains, headers, and methods are allowed.
  
  How CORS Policy Works in MuleSoft?
  MuleSoft provides a CORS Policy that can be applied to APIs through API Manager in Anypoint Platform. This policy:
  
  Defines allowed origins (e.g., https://example.com).
  Specifies allowed HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT).
  Controls which headers can be sent in requests.
  Determines whether credentials (cookies, authorization headers) can be included.

below is difference between Spike control and Rate limiting policy(sla based)
```
In MuleSoft, both Spike Control Policy and Rate Limiting Policy are used to control API traffic, but they serve slightly different purposes. Here’s a breakdown of the differences:

Feature	Spike Control Policy	Rate Limiting Policy
Purpose	Prevents sudden traffic spikes that can overwhelm the system.	Limits the number of requests a client can make within a specific time window.
Use Case	Protects APIs from sudden bursts of traffic by allowing only a certain number of requests per unit of time.	Controls API consumption by enforcing a quota over a defined time period.
Behavior	Implements a sliding window approach to gradually allow traffic instead of an abrupt limit.	Enforces a fixed limit on the number of requests allowed per time window (e.g., 1000 requests per hour).
Handling Excess Requests	Excess requests are delayed and processed gradually.	Excess requests are rejected with a 429 Too Many Requests error.
Best For	Handling sudden surges in traffic while maintaining system stability.	Enforcing contractual usage limits on API consumers.
When to Use Which?
Use Spike Control when you want to smooth out bursts of traffic and prevent system overload.
Use Rate Limiting when you want to enforce usage quotas and ensure fair consumption among API users.
