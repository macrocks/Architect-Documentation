API Governance in MuleSoft ensures that APIs are designed, developed, deployed, and managed in a secure, standardized, and scalable way. The key topics under API Governance include:

-API Naming Conventions


-Versioning Strategy
API versioning is crucial for managing changes and ensuring backward compatibility in MuleSoft applications. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of an effective API versioning strategy:
```
1. Semantic Versioning
Use semantic versioning to clearly communicate the nature of changes:

Major Versions (X.0.0): Introduce breaking changes that are not backward compatible.
Minor Versions (1.X.0): Add new features in a backward-compatible manner.
Patch Versions (1.0.X): Implement backward-compatible bug fixes1.
2. Deprecation Policy
Establish a clear deprecation policy to manage the lifecycle of API versions:

Announcement: Notify consumers about the deprecation of an API version well in advance.
Support Period: Provide a support period during which both the old and new versions are available.
Sunset: Clearly communicate the sunset date when the deprecated version will no longer be supported2.
3. Documentation and Communication
Maintain comprehensive and up-to-date documentation for each API version:

Changelog: Include a changelog that details the changes in each version.
Migration Guides: Provide guides to help consumers migrate from one version to another3.
4. Versioning in URLs
Incorporate version numbers in the API URLs to differentiate between versions:

Example: /api/v1/customers and /api/v2/customers.
5. Backward Compatibility
Ensure that minor and patch versions are backward compatible to minimize disruptions for API consumers.

6. Testing and Validation
Thoroughly test new API versions to ensure they meet quality standards and do not introduce regressions.
```
By following these strategies, you can effectively manage API versions, minimize disruptions for consumers, and maintain a high level of service quality. 

-Consistency in URI Structures
Follow and be consistent URI structure to make it more readable, concise and easy to understand. 
e.g.  /api/v1/customers
/api/{versio}/{domain}/{resource}  e.g. /api/v2/pay/accounts
