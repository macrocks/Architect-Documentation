## API Govarnance

Anypoint API Governance is a component of Anypoint Platform that enables you to apply governance rules to your APIs as part of the API lifecycle.
With Anypoint API Governance you can:
Improve your organizationâ€™s API quality:
Identify conformance issues in governed APIs and take steps to resolve them.
Share and enforce governance best practices:
Customize and publish governance rulesets to share and enforce organization-specific best practices with your developers.
Apply consistent rules from design time to deployment:
Use governance rulesets to apply centralized governance to multiple aspects of your APIs, from specifications at design time to instances at deployment.
Enforce governance within your DevOps organization:
Automate API governance in your CI/CD pipeline using CLI commands or through API solutions using the experience API.

Governance Console - 
Create governance profiles to apply governance rulesets to a targeted set of APIs. The API Governance console then provides a conformance summary for all of your validated APIs.
Monitor API conformance and notify developers to help improve conformance

## Steps to activate
1. go to anypoint platform -> API governance -> create new profile
2. search for rulesets - default 12 rulesets - you can create your custome ruleset as well
3.filter criteria -> api types, tags categories attached or API instances only
4. Notification - send email on nonconformance report
5.Profile name and usage of it

without licence you can get 10 API's through this api governance- shortcut to use it as free is to use Tags and Categories.

Dashboard on home page will show Profiles, conformance states and api's at risk.

We can create custom rulesets based on existing ruleset or from scratch as well.
