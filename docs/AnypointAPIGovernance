Identify conformance issues in governed APIs and take steps to resolve them.
Share and enforce governance best practices:
Customize and publish governance rulesets to share and enforce organization-specific best practices with your developers.
Apply consistent rules from design time to deployment:
Use governance rulesets to apply centralized governance to multiple aspects of your APIs, from specifications at design time to instances at deployment.
Enforce governance within your DevOps organization:
Automate API governance in your CI/CD pipeline using CLI commands or through API solutions using the experience API.

Create governance profiles to apply governance rulesets to a targeted set of APIs. The API Governance console then provides a conformance summary for all of your validated APIs.
