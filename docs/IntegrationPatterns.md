# Integration Patterns

we will talk about integration patterns and their implementation ways in mulesoft

1. Synchronous (REST) Based
2. Asymchronous (Event) based
3. Pub-Sub Model
4. Transformation
5. scatter-gather
6. Routing



1. Point-to-Point Integration
Pattern: Directly connects two applications.
Implementation in MuleSoft:
Use HTTP, FTP, JDBC, or proprietary connectors to establish direct communication.
Example: A Mule flow using the HTTP Connector to send data from an e-commerce system to an ERP.
2. API-Led Connectivity
Pattern: Organizes APIs into three layersâ€”System, Process, and Experience.
Implementation in MuleSoft:
System APIs: Directly expose backend systems (e.g., Salesforce, SAP).
Process APIs: Orchestrate and combine multiple System APIs.
Experience APIs: Tailor data for specific consumer needs.
Uses API Manager to enforce policies.
3. Messaging and Event-Driven Architecture
Pattern: Uses queues and topics for asynchronous communication.
Implementation in MuleSoft:
MuleSoft Anypoint MQ for decoupling services.
JMS Connector to interact with messaging systems (ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ).
Async processing with VM Queues.
4. Content Enrichment
Pattern: Enhances data by retrieving additional information.
Implementation in MuleSoft:
DataWeave to transform and merge payloads.
Mule connectors (e.g., Database, REST) to fetch additional data.
Aggregation using Scatter-Gather.
5. Content-Based Routing
Pattern: Routes messages based on content or metadata.
Implementation in MuleSoft:
Choice Router to direct messages based on conditions.
Expression-based logic using DataWeave or MEL.
6. Orchestration & Aggregation
Pattern: Combines multiple sources into a single response.
Implementation in MuleSoft:
Scatter-Gather for parallel execution.
Aggregator pattern using MuleSoft Batch Processing.
7. File-Based Integration
Pattern: Transfers data via files.
Implementation in MuleSoft:
File Connector to read/write files.
FTP/SFTP for remote file exchange.
Batch processing for large data files.
8. Transactional Integration
Pattern: Ensures ACID transactions across multiple systems.
Implementation in MuleSoft:
XA Transactions in Database Connector.
JMS Transactions for message queuing.
9. Error Handling & Retry Patterns
Pattern: Ensures resilience and retries on failures.
Implementation in MuleSoft:
Try Scope for error handling.
On Error Propagate & On Error Continue in Error Handling Strategies.
Retry Scope to handle transient failures.
