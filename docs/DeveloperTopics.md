# Streaming
Streaming in MuleSoft
Streaming in MuleSoft is a technique used to process large amounts of data efficiently without loading the entire payload into memory. It helps in improving performance and avoiding memory overflow errors when dealing with large files, databases, or API responses.

How Streaming Works in MuleSoft
MuleSoft provides different streaming strategies depending on the source of the data:

1. Repeatable In-Memory Stream
Stores the stream in memory.
Allows re-reading multiple times.
Suitable for small to medium-sized payloads.
2. Repeatable File Store Stream
Stores the stream in a temporary file.
Useful for large payloads where in-memory storage is not feasible.
Provides a balance between performance and memory usage.
3. Non-Repeatable Stream
Processes data as it arrives.
Cannot be read multiple times.
Efficient for one-time read scenarios like logging or forwarding requests.
Where is Streaming Used in MuleSoft?
File Handling – Processing large files without loading them into memory.
Database Querying – Fetching large result sets without overloading memory.
API Calls – Streaming responses from REST or SOAP APIs.
Batch Processing – Handling records efficiently in a batch job.
Example: Enabling Streaming in MuleSoft
When consuming data from APIs or reading files, you can enable streaming using the streamingStrategy attribute.

Example: Enabling Streaming in an HTTP Request
```
<http:request method="GET" url="http://example.com/largefile" streamingStrategy="MULE_STREAMING"/>
```
Example: Reading a Large File with Streaming
```
<file:read path="/data/largefile.csv" streaming="true"/>
```
Best Practices for Using Streaming in MuleSoft
Use Repeatable File Store Stream when dealing with large payloads that need to be read multiple times.
Use Non-Repeatable Stream for one-time processing to optimize performance.
Be cautious with In-Memory Streaming as it can lead to OutOfMemory errors with very large payloads.
Configure streamingStrategy explicitly to ensure efficient processing.
